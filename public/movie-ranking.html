<h1>Rohan's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>A quick top 3</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p> Into the Spiderverse is a very close hitting movie </br> 
    that inspires me to look inside and grind to become better.</p>

<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p> Baby Driver is a culmination of my childhood dream of </br>
    mastering the ability to drive and using the skill to </br>
    eventually do good. </br> 
    </br>
    It's also a love movie about finding someone who also 
    appreciates </br>
    you for being you. </p>

<h4>La La Land</h4>
<p> La La Land is a movie that takes you for a ride and just </br> 
    keeps you waiting for more. Its a movie that makes </br>
    you think deeper in life.</p>
